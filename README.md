Predicting Student Placement using Logistic Regression

This machine learning project aims to predict whether a student will secure a placement after graduation based on their academic performance. The model utilizes logistic regression, a popular and effective algorithm for binary classification problems.

Input Parameters:

- Percentage: The student's overall percentage score in their undergraduate program
- CGPA: The student's cumulative grade point average (CGPA)

Output:

- Placement Status: A binary output indicating whether the student is likely to get placed (1) or not (0), also represented as "Yes" or "No"

This project demonstrates the application of logistic regression in a real-world scenario, providing insights into the factors that influence placement outcomes. The model is implemented in [insert language/ framework] and is available on GitHub for others to learn from and build upon.
